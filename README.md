# pyCASLoss
A version of the CAS Loss Model using python

This is a python rewrite of the CAS Individual Claim Simulator.  I'm mostly doing this for a couple of reasons, 1) better learn python on something bigger that is relevant to my job and 2) I wanted to better understand the process that the CAS model uses, but I don't really like R.  

I also thought that having this in Python would make it more usable and it would be a good fit to include in a new jupyter notebook as a user interface.  

Much of the initial files are following the same basic logic as the R programs, but i will be revising them as I think python has the capability of being a simplier design.  I also don't think it need that many classes but it is something that can be a more long term goal.  

the focus is going to stick to using the basic python data science libraries, mostly numpy, pandas, and scipy.  If we can use things that already exist in the python eco-system I will.
